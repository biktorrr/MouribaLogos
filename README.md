# MouribaLogos

Logos for ICT4D projects created by Victor de Boer. The logos are available in PNG, XCF (Gimp), SVG (Inkscape) and AI (Adobe illustrator) format. 

These logos have been used for a number of ICT4D projects. Most of these projects are related to the http://w4ra.org initiative. You are free to modify these logos as you wish. I suggest to not use any of the existing logos with a project or product name without modification. I kindly ask to send me (v.de.boer@vu.nl) an email if you use a logo based on these "Mr. Mouriba" logos. If you wish to attribute me you can use: "Adapted from a logo by Victor de Boer (http://victordeboer.com)"
